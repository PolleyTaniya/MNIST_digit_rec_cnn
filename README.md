# MNIST Handwritten digit recognition using Convolutional Neural Network
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify handwritten digits from the widely-used MNIST dataset. The goal is to build and train a custom neural network capable of recognizing digits (0‚Äì9) from grayscale images with high accuracy.

The project is structured within a Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to follow and experiment with. It covers the full workflow from data loading and preprocessing, to model design, training, evaluation, and visualization.

## üîç Key Features**
Uses the **PyTorch** deep learning framework

Processes **28x28** grayscale images

**Includes two convolutional layers, followed by fully connected layers**

Trains on the MNIST dataset using a custom architecture

Evaluates performance using accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrix

Notebook includes rich comments and visualizations for learning and analysis

## üß† Why MNIST?**
The MNIST dataset is considered a ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù problem in deep learning:

Simple enough to build prototypes quickly

Complex enough to require meaningful architectures (e.g., CNNs)

## üéØ Results
**The trained CNN achieves over 98% accuracy on the test set, demonstrating strong performance and generalization on unseen digit images.**
